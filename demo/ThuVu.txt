## 👩🏻‍💻 Real-world projects & Sharing

Projects need not be big or complex. It can be as small as writing a blog post to explain about something in AI.

If you want to build a real-world AI application, find a problem you are interested in solving with AI, and build a project around it.

### 👉 **Example projects:**

🎥 [Building a Chatbot with ChatGPT API and Reddit Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1Y2enHrcU&t=557s)

🎥 [I Created a Custom GPT for Data Science Nerds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhFz0JfGvfc&t=116s)

## 💡 Mental models & Specialized AI areas

Reading books about AI is a great way to go over the noise on social media and get a more well-rounded background of AI.

### 📚 **My recommended AI book list:**

1. [Life 3.0 (Max Tegmark)](https://amzn.to/3MVo8SH)
2. [Superintelligence (Nick Bostrom)](https://amzn.to/3MRKSTs)
3. [The Coming Wave (Mustafa Suleyman, Michael Bhaskar)](https://amzn.to/3MT8Ldv)
4. [Power and Progress (Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson)](https://amzn.to/47L6UiH)
5. [Human Compatible (Stuart Russell)](https://amzn.to/3sQpZBk)
6. [The Alignment Problem (Brian Christian)](https://amzn.to/3SO1uPO)
7. [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, Global Edition (Peter Norvig, Stuart Russell)](https://amzn.to/3G50wHs)
8. [I, Human: AI, Automation, and the Quest to Reclaim What Makes Us Unique (Tomas Chamorro-Premuzi)](https://amzn.to/3SVIfUu)

### Specialized AI topics:

Choose one or a few AI areas you are interested in to dive deeper.

- **Advanced prompt engineering methods** to improve quality of the LLM responses, like self-consistency, chain of thoughts prompting, or automatic prompting.
- **AutoGen (Microsoft):** allows you to develop LLM applications using multiple agents that can converse with each other to solve tasks.
- **Advanced document QA** with multi modal documents that can work well with complex tables, images and other data structures.
- **AI security and hacking:** The other day I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3ybnXjtpIc) of a researcher who uncovers some serious security issues with machine learning model. This is a very overlooked area until now, so if you know computer security very well, please do humanity a favor and look into this!
